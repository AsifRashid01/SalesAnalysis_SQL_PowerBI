# SalesAnalysis_SQL_PowerBI

### Setup
- This project requires SQL Server (SQL Express), Power BI Desktop
- We will work with backup Data Warehouse (DW) data and Lightweight (LT) data. Obtain data and restore following instructions from [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms)
- Compare DW and LT data to understand the difference between structured and unstructured data. We will primarily be working with Data Warehouse data.
- Update Data Warehouse data using [sql script.](https://github.com/techtalkcorner/SampleDemoFiles/blob/master/Database/AdventureWorks/Update_AdventureWorksDW_Data.sql)

### Business Request & User Stories
- Read the sample business request, demand overview & filled-out user stories to understand the problem we are trying to solve with Data Analysis and what we consider as a solution.

### Clean the Data using T-SQL
- Understand the difference between FACT tables & Dimension tables.
- Identify which tables in the data are of interest with the help of the Business Request form.
- Choose which columns are of interest to export by preparing and transforming these columns in SQL using concepts such as: renaming columns, combining columns, commenting in SQL script, formatting of SQL statements, WHERE clause, ORDER BY, LEFT JOIN, CASE() function and ISNULL() function.
